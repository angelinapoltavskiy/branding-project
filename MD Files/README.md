## **MISSION STATEMENT**
Eradicating fast fashion through increasing access to resources for sustainable fashion. 
  
## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
According to the World Bank, less than 1% of used clothing is recycled into new clothes. In order to keep up with trends that are changing faster and faster, the fashion industry is forced to produce garments at an ever-increasing pace. Currently, the fashion industry is responsible for ten percent of annual global carbon emissions. If the current lifestyle and trend patterns continue to evolve the same way they are now, worldwide clothing consumption is predicted to go from 2019’s sixty-two million metric tons to one hundred and two million tons in the coming ten years (World Bank, 2019). This will cause greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the fashion industry to raise over fifty percent by 2030. Whether it's due to the quickening trend cycles, or outgrowing clothes, a very large part of the population chooses to throw their clothes away instead of donating or repurposing them. Fifty-seven percent of all this thrown away clothing ends up in landfills, which are eventually incinerated (Le, 2020). All this incineration is releasing more and more toxins into our atmosphere, increasing the rate at which global warming is affecting us all, especially marginalized communities. 

Currently some solutions that lend themselves to this issue include researching before buying in order to only buy from sustainable brands, buying from secondhand sources, and resale platforms such as Depop and Poshmark. None of these existing solutions address the issue of how consumers often don’t know how to go about researching the sustainability of their favorite brands. The solution that we would like to propose in light of this is a website which contains a database of brands. The database would list which are the most sustainable, and if a consumer wanted to find sustainable alternatives that create products with similar aesthetics to a fast fashion brand, then the database could show the sustainable alternative to the fast-fashion brand. This database would help shoppers opt for more sustainable brands, decreasing the number of incinerations and greenhouse gas emissions in relation to fast fashion.
