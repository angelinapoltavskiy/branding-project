# **THE PROBLEM**

The problem we would like to address is the lack of knowledge and access to sustainable fashion brands. According to the world bank, less than 1% of used clothing is recycled into new clothes. In order to keep up with trends that are changing faster and faster, the fashion industry is forced to produce garments at an ever-increasing pace. Currently, the fashion industry is responsible for ten percent of annual global carbon emissions. If the current lifestyle and trend patterns continue to evolve the same way they are now, worldwide clothing consumption is predicted to go from 2019’s sixty-two million metric tons to one hundred and two million tons in the coming ten years (World Bank, 2019). This will cause greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the fashion industry to rise by over fifty percent by 2030. Each step in the life cycle of producing clothes has a negative environmental impact, and the fashion industry produces an estimated 92 million tons of waste per year (Niinimäki, K., Peters, G., Dahlbo, H. et al, 2020).
Whether it's due to quickening trend cycles, short-lived garment use, or outgrowing clothes, a very large part of the population chooses to throw their clothes away instead of donating or repurposing them. Fifty-seven percent of all this thrown away clothing ends up in landfills, which are eventually incinerated (Le, 2020). All this incineration is releasing more and more toxins into our atmosphere, increasing the rate at which global warming is affecting us all, especially marginalized communities. 
The scope that our problem statement is addressing is consumers who live in the US or Canada, so we will be focusing on brands that ship their products within the US and Canada. 
Currently, some solutions that lend themselves to this issue include researching before buying in order to only buy from sustainable brands, renting clothes from fashion subscription platforms like Rent The Runway, and buying from secondhand sources like thrift stores or resale platforms such as Depop and Poshmark. None of these existing solutions address the issue of how consumers often don’t know how to go about researching the sustainability of their favorite brands. 

Our definition of a sustainable clothing brand: 
While there are varying definitions of what makes a clothing brand sustainable, we will be focusing on including brands in our database that are both ethical and environmentally friendly. This means including brands that pay living wages, don’t exploit their employees, don’t use child labor, and avoid depleting natural resources in the process of producing clothes.

## **Solution Summary**
The solution that we would like to propose in light of this is a website that contains a database of brands that ship their products within the US and Canada. The database would list sustainability factors of different brands, and if a consumer wanted to find sustainable alternatives that create products with similar aesthetics to a fast fashion brand, then they could use the sort and search filters to find their desired aesthetic brand. This database would help shoppers opt for more sustainable brands, decreasing the number of incinerations and greenhouse gas emissions in relation to fast fashion.
