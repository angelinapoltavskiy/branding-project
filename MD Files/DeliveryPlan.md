# Delivery Plan

## What will the project management practices be?
	
* Establish milestones, plan deadlines, and deliverables as a team
	
* PM will create tasks on Github and assign owners, will also track/monitor task progress
	
* Start Quality Assurance process early and keep testing often and iteratively 
	
* Keep communicating frequently and openly about workload, check in with team members about their roles and responsibilities during class on Mondays and Wednesdays.
 
* Checking in asynchronously through Facebook Messenger throughout the week and on Sundays to finalize deliverables.

* Redelegate tasks or split up tasks among team members as needed. 

* All of the large, group decisions will be made during our in class meeting times, and smaller, more minor decisions can be made through our Facebook Messenger chat or on our Tuesday Zoom meetings. 


## Will you have meetings? How frequently? Who plans their agendas?
	
* Weekly meetings and work time during class time on Mondays and Wednesdays
	
* Additional outside of class meetings on Tuesdays from 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM to go over blockers, questions, and complete collaborative tasks if needed. 
	
* The PM (Tala) plans the agendas.
